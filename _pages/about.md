Welcome! My name is Hassan, and I am a ðŸ¤ž soon-to-be engineer. Sometimes I am an engineer who codes, however most of the time you will find me designing solutions and exploring paradigms. I love **systems**, and right now I am most interested in Unix as an operating **system**, where <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file'>everything is a file</a>.

I started to care about computers back in 2011, when I stumbled upon torrenting on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay'>The Pirate Bay</a>. This exposed me to a whole new world about: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer'>peer-to-peer networks</a>, why my graphics drivers won't run my favourite game <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas'>GTA: San Andreas</a>, how to mess around with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry>'>Windows Registry</a>, and so on... All of this led onto me having interests in many diverse technological domains, including video editing, robotics (pneumatics, control systems, 3D printing), and game design.
