Welcome! My name is Hassan. You can find here my experiences, musings, and whatever else I choose to share. I am a person who likes to explore and inquire. I do this as an engineer interested in computer systems, a part-time automobile enthusiast, and a human trying to understand [how we know what we know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology). Most content here will be regarding my engineering interests, so it's only fair for me to introduce how I got into it.

I started to care about computers when I was 9 and I stumbled upon [torrenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay'>The Pirate Bay</a>. This exposed a new world to me about: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer'>peer-to-peer networks</a>, why my graphics drivers won't run <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas'>my favorite game</a>, how I can tinker with the Windows OS using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry>'>registry</a>, and so on... All this knowledge led to having many diverse interests mainly within technological domains, including video editing, operating systems, robotics (pneumatics, control systems, 3D printing), and game design.

Sometimes I am an engineer who codes, however, most of the time you will find me designing solutions and exploring programming paradigms. I love working with systems at scale, and right now I am most interested in Unix where [everything is a file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file). Through my internships, I have gained experience in building systems that solve important infrastructure problems, including [immutability](https://glossary.cncf.io/immutable-infrastructure/), synchronized [time-series monitoring](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/), and [inter-node communication](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/patterns-of-inter-node-communication-in-distributed-systems-da76f33796ea) in distributed systems.

The page might be hard to read at times. Writing is hard, which is partly why I started this blog. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!
